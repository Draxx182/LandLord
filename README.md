Currently testing LandLord.py. There are bugs like making the property.bin a little bigger in terms of size, I will fix that.
For now, I want to focus on whether or not this thing actually works or not, feel free to DM @Draxx#9906 if it breaks anything.

# Usage
Drag and Drop property.bin into LandLord.exe and it'll create a folder.

# Warning
Once Exe has been created, it may come up as malware by windows defender. I assure you it's not, but if you don't trust it then feel free to not use it.

# Credit
A massive thank you to HeartlessSeph who found out the pointers for property.bin
Thanks to Retraso for providing some base code.
Sutando for providing me with the PyBinaryReader.

Without these guys, this project would've been a lot harder and more time consuming.
